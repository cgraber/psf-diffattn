# [Joint Forecasting of Panoptic Segmentations with Difference Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07157)
**Colin Graber, Cyril Jazra, Wenjie Luo, Liangyan Gui, Alexander Schwing - CVPR 2022**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

### Dependencies
- pytorch v.1.10.0 
- detectron2 version 0.4.1 (newer versions will cause errors)
- cityscapesscripts
- opencv
- PIL 
- numpy

Install the code using the following command:
`pip install -e ./`

### Data 
You will need to download the following datasets from the Cityscapes website. They should be placed in the data/cityscapes/ folder:
- gtFine_trainvaltest.zip
- leftImg8bit_sequence_trainvaltest.zip
- vehicle_sequence.zip
- timestamp_sequence.zip


## Running our code
use the script run.sh to train the model
There are three steps that can be run in the current version of this code:
1) extracting the appearance features for every instance using the pre-trained model.
2) training the box forecasting model
3) training the appearance forecasting model

COMING SOON: the steps required to train the refinement head. This includes a large amount of data preprocessing, and this is coming soon!
